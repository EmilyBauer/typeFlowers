Hello!

This is my program (very very incomplete) that will allow a person to track their writing progress.
This is to help people who find the writing process difficult and need motivational assistance.

Aside from actually writing it, future updates could include adding scenic options, time tracking, large database compiling most productive times, an NLP to customize what is displayed to the story and more. I'll be updating on a very particular and peculiar schedule, and althogh the idea is rather basic and i've heard of something similar being done, I may take a while.

More soon!
