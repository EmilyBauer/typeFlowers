Hello!
 
This is my program (very very incomplete) that will allow a person to track their writing progress.
This is to help people who find the writing process difficult and need motivational assistance.

Aside from actually writing it, future updates could include adding scenic options, time tracking, large database compiling most productive times, an NLP to customize what is displayed to the story and more. I'll be updating on a very particular and peculiar schedule, and althogh the idea is rather basic and i've heard of something similar being done, I may take a while.

The main file being used is the HTML one, not main.py. I was having difficulties creating a textbox area. HTML however has that textarea thing that I had tried before. I also just learned about using Javascript/jQuery with HTML, so now the project is moving somewhere. My mind is still having a hard time thinking through solutions.

I also have Alishba making me sprites

More soon!

The solution requires using a database to store the textarea information. As I look into optimal solutions, I shall also be working in a different repository for Binochle
