Hello!
 
This is my program (very very incomplete) that will allow a person to track their writing progress.
This is to help people who find the writing process difficult and need motivational assistance.

Aside from actually writing it, future updates could include adding scenic options, time tracking, large database compiling most productive times, an NLP to customize what is displayed to the story and more. I'll be updating on a very particular and peculiar schedule, and although the idea is rather basic and I've heard of something similar being done, I may take a while.

The goal of this design is to document and evaluate the design of a website created to encourage writing in university and high-school level students. Originally I had wanted this to encourage my personal extra-curricular writing, of which I have a couple projects.

My failure in creating a successful report. Is proof. that this is needed.
